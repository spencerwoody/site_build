date: '2018-11-25'

I recently gave to a talk which counted as my oral examination to
officially enter candidacy. This talk mostly concerned work on
post-selection inference that I've completed with my advisor James
Scott, but it also briefly introduced some ongoing work concerning
posterior summarization.

My committee members are:

- Professor James Scott (advisor)
- Professor Carlos Carvalho
- Professor Jared Murray
- Professor Cory Zigler

Slides from my talk are available [here](/files/Woody-oralexam.pdf).

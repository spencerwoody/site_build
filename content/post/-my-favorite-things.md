Basically a site where I collect a bunch of links I've found useful over the past in my work in statistics / data science. "If you have an idea, write it down."

To do: add style guide... emoji cheatsheet maybe header image too?

## Online learning resources 

### The holy trinity of books written by Hadley Wickham
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
- [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)

## Textbooks etc.

Books are nice, especially if they're not made of paper :smile:

- [*The Elements of Statistical Learning* by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
- [*The Bayesian Choice* by Christian Robert](https://errorstatistics.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/robert-20071.pdf) 

## Reference for `ggplot2` & visualization in R :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

I recommend to every R user, no matter their skill level, to take the plunge into using only `ggplot2` for producing visualizations in R. Yes, there's a learning curve, but in my opinion, once you learn the "grammar" behind it, you can make plots much more quickly because of the much greater consistency.

- [R for Data Science, Chapter 3](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html): A good primer for begineers
- [Top 50 ggplot2 Visualizations](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html): A great reference for producing a wide variety of data visualizations
- [`viridis` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html): "Use the color scales in this package to make plots that are pretty, better represent your data, easier to read by those with colorblindness, and print well in grey scale"

## Reference for `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo` <a name="rcpp"></a>

Man, I *really* need to build this list...

## Blogs and feeds I follow <a name="blogs"></a>

- [#rstats on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
- [Hadley Wickham's twitter](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)
- [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://andrewgelman.com)
- [Deborah Mayo's blog](https://errorstatistics.com)

## Miscellaneous

- [`dplyr::progress_estimated`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/progress_estimated.html)
- [Progress bars in `Rcpp`](http://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/using-rcppprogress/)
- [Use emojis for GitHub](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)

## Work I'm doing

- Collaborating with Sandia National Labs on Bayesian model calibration and 
uncertainty quantification under model misspecification
- Original research on post-selection inference, for application to sparse normal means problem 
and spatial hotspot detection

## Conferences I am attending

### ACIC

[Atlantic Causal Inference Conference](https://www.cmu.edu/acic2018/)  
May 21 - 23, 2018  
Carnegie Melon University  
Pittsburgh, PA

### ISBA

[ISBA World Meeting 2018](https://bayesian.org/isba2018/)  
June 24 - 29, 2018  
University of Edinburgh  
United Kingdom 

I'll be presenting on June 28 about a method of quantifying undercertainty of signal magnitude for selected regions in spatial modeling. You can find my slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inoiTWassTmKRD-wSiQpA9n1RmzZRHzq/view?usp=sharing).

My advisor, James Scott, will be presenting similar topic, this one being post-selection inference in the sparse normal means problem. [[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TDmpOgruILhqMQmOQCiyGBy-480TyHXU/view?usp=sharing)]

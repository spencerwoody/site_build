Statistics PhD Student

<p>Hi, I’m Spencer Woody. I am a third year PhD student in statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor James Scott. My main research interests are in post-selection inference as applied to multiple testing, model selection, and spatial hotspot detection scenarios. I also work as a research assistant for Professor Carlos Carvahlo, with whom I am working on problems in causal inference and posterior summarization.</p>
<p>From 2017-2018 I worked as an statistician in the laboratory of Dr. Livia Eberlin at the UT Department of Chemisty. The Eberlin Lab apply ambient mass spectrometry techniques to tissue diagnosis, disease biomarker detection, and other clinical settings. I have also worked as a statistical consultant for the Department of Women’s Health at the Dell Medical School.</p>

<center> <h2>Statistics PhD Student</h2> </center>

Hi, Iâ€™m Spencer Woody. I am a third year PhD student in statistics at
the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor James
Scott. My main research interests are in post-selection inference as
applied to multiple testing, model selection, and spatial hotspot
detection scenarios. I also work as a research assistant for Professor
Carlos Carvahlo, with whom I am working on problems in causal
inference and posterior summarization. 

From 2017-2018 I worked as an statistician in the laboratory of
Dr. Livia Eberlin at the UT Department of Chemisty. The Eberlin Lab
apply ambient mass spectrometry techniques to tissue diagnosis,
disease biomarker detection, and other clinical settings. I have also
worked as a statistical consultant for the Department of Women's
Health at the Dell Medical School.

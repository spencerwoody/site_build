### COVID-19 

I am currently working on a COVID-19 mortality forecast, along with
Professor Lauren Meyers and the rest of the [UT-Austin COVID-19
Modeling Consortium][consortium].

- [Mortality forecast for US, 50 US states + DC, and metropolitan
  areas][covid-19 forecast] (updated daily as new data come in)
- [Current and past][covid-19-github] versions of our forecasts in
  .CSV format
- [Latest version][latest-covid-19] and [preprint
  version][preprint-covid-19] of the technical report for our model

### About me

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in statistics at the University of
Texas at Austin, within the [Department of Statistics and Data
Sciences][sds].  I am co-supervised by Professors [James Scott][james]
and [Jared Murray][jared], and work as a research assistant for
Professor [Carlos Carvahlo][carlos].  <!-- My main research interests are -->
<!-- in causal inference, treatment modification, posterior model -->
<!-- interpretation, and post-selection inference as applied to multiple -->
<!-- testing. -->

From 2017 to 2018 I worked as a statistician in the laboratory of
Dr. Livia Eberlin at the UT Department of Chemisty. The [Eberlin
Lab][eberlin] apply ambient mass spectrometry techniques to tissue
diagnosis, disease biomarker detection, and other clinical settings. I
have also worked as a statistical consultant for the [Department of
Women's Health][womens-health] at the Dell Medical School.


### Research Interests

- Causal inference
- Heterogeneous treatment effects
- Model interpretation
- Multiple testing
- Post-selection inference
- Uncertainty quantification
<!-- - High-throughput bioinformatics -->

### Education

- The University of Texas at Austin (2016 -- present)
	- PhD, Statistics
- Duke University (2011 -- 2015)
	- BS in Economics and Statistical Science

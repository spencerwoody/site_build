I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in statistics at the University of Texas at
Austin, within the [Department of Statistics and Data
Sciences][sds]. I am co-supervisored by Professors [James
Scott][james] and [Jared Murray][jared]. My main research interests
are in post-selection inference as applied to multiple testing, model
selection, and spatial hotspot detection scenarios. I also work as a
research assistant for Professor [Carlos Carvahlo][carlos], working on
problems in causal inference and posterior summarization.

From 2017 to 2018 I worked as a statistician in the laboratory of
Dr. Livia Eberlin at the UT Department of Chemisty. The [Eberlin
Lab][eberlin] apply ambient mass spectrometry techniques to tissue
diagnosis, disease biomarker detection, and other clinical settings. I
have also worked as a statistical consultant for the [Department of
Women's Health][womens-health] at the Dell Medical School.
